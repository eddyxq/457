Download every file in this directory including my outputs

Compile your code as follows:
g++ pagesim.cpp -o pagesim

run run.sh script as follows:
bash run.sh

It is just a simple output string check on your output file my_out.txt and my output file ta_out.txt. As long as you use the same output format as me, we should have the same outputs.

NOTE: For LRU and optimal algorithms, starting from the first index of frames, whenever I find an empty slot, I directly select that slot for replacement and break the loop.

This is not an official grader. There may be cases which are not covered here and included in the grading test cases. Please do your own tests as well.

Let me know if you think there is a problem with the sample outputs.
